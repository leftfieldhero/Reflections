What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates an environment where we can track changes through commits and 
using git's simple commands to get information about those commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area hold what you told it to hold at the time you added it 
to the area where as you working directory is where in the log you are 
currently.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

The staging area is one step away from commiting and if you have one 
logical change that occured over multiple files then this will allow you 
to add them in one commit all at the same time.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your 
history organized? How would branches help? 

This would be if I wanted to make a large change without impacting 
working code.  Examples would be adding a different language or some 
experimental feature.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams help build the commit "tree" that will show us where we are and 
if we've made any branches and how they related to the "master" banch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent 
it in the diagram the way we do?

When we merge the information that was changed on each branch it is 
combined together in a way that account for all changes on both branches. 
This shows when the branch and merge were made.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing 
merges manually?

Automatic merging is quick and will notify you of suspected conflicts.  
Manually merges allow you not to use git and could take much longer 
depending on the size of the code.
