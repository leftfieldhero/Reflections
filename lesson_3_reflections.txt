When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

I'd be nice to access my work from no matter where I am and storing 
information on a server while
in this case not privately it does solve the issue of sharing information 
and accessibility.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Autmomatically staying up-to-date could result in changing parts of code 
that I didn't want public of getting code that is in another branch that 
someone else may be working on. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would 
you use one instead of another?

A fork is a like a clone that only occurs on GitHub. A fork is used when 
trying to copy information from someone elses GitHub to my own. A clone 
will copy a git repository regardless of where it resides and should be 
used when you need to copy a repository. A branch is a part of a 
repository and should be used when experimenting on features that you 
don't want to interfere with the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
